# How to build
Detailed instructions for the scan are in the file **helper.txt**

## Trial runs
To check the correctness of the work, we used test datasets generated by the neural network,
we leave them in this folder (**".csv"** files). The text sets contain the results of surveys of 200+ and 500+ people. The speed results are presented below:

|     Size        |   Processing speed   |
|-----------------|----------------------|
|  200 responses  |      3.4 seconds     |
|  500 responses  |      4.8 seconds     |
